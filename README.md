# devgrub
Recipe website for programmers made as an assignment for a web development course at Uppsala University. The idea is to display recipies as code as a wink to the *recipe being an algoritm* analogy.

The page can be viewed here: [https://h0nkz.github.io/devgrub/index.html](https://h0nkz.github.io/devgrub/index.html) 

As this is was assignment the solution has not been maintained since, therefore only the home page and the getRandomRecipe() page still works.
